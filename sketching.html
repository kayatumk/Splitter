      <h1> Ideation and Sketches </h1>
      <p> In the second phase of the design process, initial ideations and sketches were undertaken as the beginning of the app 
        development. The sketches, inspired by the opportunities discussed in the research stage, were of a low fidelity level 
        with the sole aim of laying a foundation for the prototyping stage. The generated sketches to highlight the improvements 
        we wish to make on our app are shown as follows.   </p>
