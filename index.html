            <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <p> Social outings among friends and families are normal practices in society. Friends, family, 
                    and new acquaintances seeking to solidify relationships usually meet in groups or pairs at 
                    restaurants, bars and various settings to share meals and experiences (Sassler and Miller, 2015). 
                    Nonetheless, the beauty of these hangouts can be marred by rifts, disagreements, and inconvenience 
                    due to payment challenges including who to pay, or how the bill should be proportioned for payment. 
                    In view of this, this report aims to design a bill sharing app that concisely caters to the needs
                    of users and fills in to resolve pain point issues that exist in current solutions. This is done 
                    by conducting market research to understand user needs. Additionally, a competitors’ analysis is 
                    conducted to explore current solutions, along with a user journey map to graphically show the goals, 
                    pain points and opportunities for improvement. Through the evidence received, a detailed problem statement 
                    is produced with a corresponding plan for possible developments to address those challenges.

            <h1> Market Research </h1>

<h2> Motivation </h2>

<p> Market research was conducted to investigate customer engagement with bill sharing apps. The purpose is to understand the 
    effectiveness of these apps in allowing for easy bill splitting while unearthing user needs and challenges in using these 
    applications.  This provides a basis upon which a more effective tool can be developed to directly combat challenges faced 
    by users. </p>

<h2> Research Methods and Data Gathering Process </h2>

<p> A qualitative research design was adopted to gather data on customer use of bill sharing apps. This research approach was 
    preferred over other methods due to its ability to provide an in-depth means of understanding the behaviors, patterns, and 
    mindsets of users (Jansen, 2010; Busetto, Wick and Gumbinger, 2020).

    A survey method was adopted to gather the data using Google Forms.  A total of 24 questions were generated which reflected 
    how often people find themselves in situations where they need to share bill cost and asked questions about how they manage to 
    share the bill. Additionally, specific questions were asked to directly zone in participants’ awareness of bill sharing apps, 
    their motivations and frustrations and the likelihood of recommending such apps to others. 
    
    The survey was open to all people although we were a lot more interested in getting responses from people who often went out 
    in groups and needed a means to share the bills. A

        to the survey site was shared among friends and family, who were both encouraged to take the survey and to share the link with their circles. </p>

            <h1> Data Analysis </h1>
<p> We received a total of 12 responses from both male and female. Through a careful analysis of the responses, we recognized that 50% of 
    respondents occasionally enjoy eating out at restaurants, 41% eat out often and the remaining 8.3% find themselves out at restaurants 
    sometimes.  When asked if they usually go out alone or as part of a group, 74.9% said they go out as part of a group while 8.3% said 
    they go out as part of a twin with the remaining 16.6% answering with yes or no.

    When asked which mode of payment they preferred when dining out, 41.7% said they pay by card, 33.3% said they use Apple Pay, and 25% 
    pay by cash with all of them agreeing that they found their preferred mode of payment convenient. When asked if their mode of payment 
    was always accepted, 83.3% answered yes while 16.7% said no. When asked if they use other methods of payment apart from their preferred 
    option, 58.3% said yes while 41.7% said no. And when queried on if their usual mode of payment was applicable when eating out in a group 
    and if the bill requires sharing, 75% answered yes while 25% said no. When asked on their awareness of bill sharing apps to settle bills 
    and if they used any, all respondents answered no. Hence, respondents were unable to give information on motivation or difficulties in 
    using bill sharing apps or the likelihood of recommending those apps. </p>
