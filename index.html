            <h1> 1.0 Introduction </h1>
Social outings among friends and families are normal practices in society. Friends, family, and new
acquaintances seeking to solidify relationships usually meet in groups or pairs at restaurants, bars
and various settings to share meals and experiences (Sassler and Miller, 2015). Nonetheless, the
beauty of these hangouts can be marred by rifts, disagreements, and inconvenience due to payment
challenges including who to pay, or how the bill should be proportioned for payment. In view of
this, this report aims to design a bill sharing app that concisely caters to the needs of users and fills
in to resolve pain point issues that exist in current solutions. This is done by conducting market
research to understand user needs (in section 2). Additionally, a competitors’ analysis is conducted
to explore current solutions (in section 3), along with a user journey map to graphically show the
goals, pain points and opportunities for improvement. Through the evidence received, a detailed
problem statement is produced with a corresponding plan for possible developments to address
those challenges (in section 4).

            <h1> 2.0 Market Research </h1>

<h2> 2.1 Motivation </h2>

Market research was conducted to investigate customer engagement with bill sharing apps. The
purpose is to understand the effectiveness of these apps in allowing for easy bill splitting while
unearthing user needs and challenges in using these applications. This provides a basis upon which
a more effective tool can be developed to directly combat challenges faced by users.

<h2> 2.2 Research Methods and Data Gathering Process </h2>

A qualitative research design was adopted to gather data on customer use of bill sharing apps. This
research approach was preferred over other methods due to its ability to provide an in-depth means
of understanding the behaviors, patterns, and mindsets of users (Jansen, 2010; Busetto, Wick and
Gumbinger, 2020).
A survey method was adopted to gather the data using Google Forms. A total of 24 questions
were generated which reflected how often people find themselves in situations where they need to
share bill cost and asked questions about how they manage to share the bill. Additionally, specific
2
questions were asked to directly zone in participants’ awareness of bill sharing apps, their
motivations and frustrations and the likelihood of recommending such apps to others.
The survey was open to all people although we were a lot more interested in getting responses
from people who often went out in groups and needed a means to share the bills. A link to the
survey site was shared among friends and family, who were both encouraged to take the survey
and to share the link with their circles (details of the survey are shown in Appendix B).
