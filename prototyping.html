        The sketches were further transformed into a prototype (link to prototype in appendix). The click through prototyping method 
        was adopted to generate a mid-fidelity prototype model in Adobe XD. The model prototype named “Splitter”, encapsulated features 
        including the ability to create groups and add members by searching for friends and family from your contact list, split group 
        bills by percentages, change languages in settings, scan receipts with the image-to-text translation feature, ability to easily 
        reimburse and get reimbursed by group members, and also pay for bills in-app by way of linking your bank account and credit card.

        A typical walkthrough of the prototype starts by signing up as a new user or logging in if you are a returning user on the home 
        screen. You are then directed to the user homepage where you can see your groups or create new ones if you do not belong to any. 
        If you do not belong to a group and wish to create your own, you can do so by searching for friends and family from your contact 
        list in the search bar located at the top of the homepage. The user also has access to a settings page where you can edit your 
        profile, accept requests from friends to join groups, change language, and access receipt history. If there is a bill to be shared 
        amongst group members, this is done by scanning the receipt and the app’s image-to-text feature translates the bill into the app 
        which is then split equally among the group. You can then proceed to pay your share of the bill by credit card and bank details 
        linked to the app.

        The development of the prototype served several functions. Firstly, it enabled the validation of working assumptions and ideas. 
        Additionally, the process helped to evaluate the technical feasibility of suggested features which were observed to be viable. 
        It was observed that through developing the prototype, failure points and risk components were able to be detected at the onset 
        to enable adequate correction right at the start. Moreover, the prototype enabled easy communication with potential users and other 
        stakeholders who were allowed to engage with the model to assess their behavior. Through this effort, the model was able to be tested 
        to evaluate whether the design fulfilled user needs. Link to our prototype can be found
